            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups water (100°F)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp instant dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups (500 g) unbleached bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (13 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp (12 g) fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp lard (solidified)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp instant dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups (500 g) unbleached bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (13 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp (12 g) fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp lard (solidified)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <pre>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</pre>
            <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the warm water and yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 minutes. The mixture should get slightly foamy, and the yeast should dissolve.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer bowl, add the flour, sugar, and salt. Mix together thoroughly. With the dough hook attachment, start mixing on medium-low speed. Slowly add the warm yeast mixture and the lard. Mix until combined. Once a cohesive dough is formed, keep mixing for another 3--5 minutes, or until smooth.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball, and place in a greased bowl covered with greased plastic wrap. Let rise at room temp for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough to release the gas and place on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 2 even pieces. Cover with a damp towel, and let them rest right where they are for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flatten out 1 piece of dough into about a 1/2-inch thick rectangle, with the long edge 10'' long.</li>
            <li>From the long edge, tightly roll the dough and close the seams at the bottom and sides.</li>
            <li>Carefully roll the log while applying pressure outward to slightly taper the ends. The log should be ~15'' long.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the other piece of dough.</li>
            <li>Place the loaves onto a parchment-lined baking sheet 4--6'' apart. Cover with another baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Let the dough proof for >30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>About 10 minutes before the dough is done proofing, bring a 10'' oven-proof skillet of water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Using a spray bottle, lightly spray the dough with water.</li>
            <li>Using a razor blade or an extremely sharp knife, score a shallow seam along the length of the loaves.</li>
            <li>Place the skillet of boiling water on the bottom rack of the oven.</li>
            <li>Place the baking sheet with the dough in the middle of the oven on a separate rack above the water.</li>
            <li>Spray the inside of the oven with a little water to generate steam.</li>
            <li>Let the bread steam for 8--10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375°F, remove the skillet of water, and let the bread bake for another 20--22 minutes, or until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Let cool completely on a wire rack. Slice and serve. Store on the counter loosely wrapped in a kitchen towel for up to 2 days and then in a resealable bag for 1 more day. Freeze in an airtight container for up to 2 months.</li>
