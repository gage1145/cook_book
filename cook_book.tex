\recipe[Perfect for making Cubano sandwiches.]{Cubano Bread}{Gage}
\serves{4}
\preptime{2 hour}
\cooktime[Cook time]{28--35 minutes}
\dishtype{\vegetarian, \bread}
\dishother{\makeahead}
\begin{ingreds}
    1$\frac{1}{4}$ cups water (\temp{100})
    1 tbsp instant dry yeast
    3$\frac{1}{2}$ cups (500g) unbleached bread flour
    1 tbsp (13g) granulated sugar
    2 tsp (12g) fine sea salt
    2$\frac{1}{2}$ tbsp lard, solidified
% \columnbreak
% \ingredients[For the Crumble Mixture:]
%      80g wholemeal flour
%      80g plain flour
%      80g butter (diced)
%      70g demerara sugar
\end{ingreds}
\begin{method}[Preheat the oven to \temp{400}.]
    In a small bowl, stir together the warm water and yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 min. The mixture should get slightly foamy, and the yeast should dissolve.\par
    In a stand mixer bowl, add the flour, sugar, and salt. Mix together thoroughly. With the dough hook attachment, start mixing on medium-low speed. Slowly add the warm yeast mixture and the lard. Mix until combined. Once a cohesive dough is formed, keep mixing for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until smooth.\par
    Shape the dough into a ball, and place in a greased bowl covered with greased plastic wrap. Let rise at room temp for 45 min to 1 hr, or until doubled in size.\par
    Punch down the dough to release the gas and place on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 2 even pieces. Cover with a damp towel, and let them rest right where they are for 10 minutes.\par
    Flatten out 1 piece of dough into about a $\frac{1}{2}$-inch thick rectangle, with the long edge about 10 inches long. From the long edge, tightly roll the dough and close the seams at the bottom and sides.\par
    Carefully roll the log while applying pressure outward to slightly taper the ends. The log should be 15 inches long. Repeat with the other piece of dough.\par
    Place the loaves onto a parchment-lined baking sheet 4--6 inches apart. Cover with another baking sheet. Let the dough proof for about 30 minutes at room temp.\par
    About 10 minutes before the dough is done proofing, bring a 10" oven-proof skillet of water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Remove the top baking sheet. Using a food-safe spray bottle, lightly spray the dough with water. Using a razor blade or an extremely sharp knife, score a shallow seam along the length of the loaves.\par
    Place the skillet of boiling water on the bottom rack of the oven. Place the baking sheet with the dough in the middle of the oven on a separate rack above the water. Spray the inside of the oven with a little water to generate steam.\par
    Let the bread steam for 8--10 minutes. Reduce the heat to \temp{375}, remove the skillet of water, and let the bread bake for another 20--22 minutes, or until lightly browned.\par
    Let cool completely on a wire rack. Slice and serve. Store on the counter loosely wrapped in a kitchen towel for up to 2 days and then in a resealable bag for 1 more day. Freeze in an airtight container for up to 2 months.\par

    2 large eggs
    1$\frac{1}{2}$ cups buttermilk
\end{ingreds}
\begin{method}[Preheat an 8” cast-iron skillet in the oven at \temp{400}]
    In a small pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, continue cooking to brown the butter until it turns dark brown. Then turn off the heat.\par
    Add the sage and thyme, stir to combine, transfer the butter-herb mixture to a separate container, and set aside to cool.\par
    In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, brown sugar, salt, baking powder, and cornmeal.\par
