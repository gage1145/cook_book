	With a meat mallet, flatten the pork loin portions until they are $\frac{1}{2}$'' thick; season with salt and a pinch of MSG.\@\par
    Place in the fridge for 30 minutes or overnight.\par
	Set up your breading station by placing the flour, beaten eggs and panko, in separate bowls.\par
    Toss the meat in the flour, coating completely, and shake off the excess\par
    Dip in the egg wash and let it drain slightly\par
    Press it into the panko and make sure everything is well covered.\par
    Repeat with all the chops.
	Fill up a large pot with 2$\frac{1}{2}$'' of vegetable oil and heat to \temp{340}.\par
